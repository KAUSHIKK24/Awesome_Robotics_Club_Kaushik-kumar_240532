The most fascinating  thing about the project , Autonomous Navigation , is how a robot
can think  on its own  about a  way to reach a particular point .
The ability of the bot to find the path and even the shortest one saving cost.
I have seen same types bot on online platforms called as maze solvers that is also a kind of autonomous navigation
